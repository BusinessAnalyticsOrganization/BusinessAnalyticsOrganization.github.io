<p>We typically try to offer a mix of events each semester based on interest amongst our members. All events typically have a limited number of seats and require an RSVP which will be included in communications about the specific event! We offer these spots on a first come, first serve basis but hope to offer enough events for all members to participate across a given semester.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or doubts about an event feel free to contact a E-Board member in our Slack group or directly via email, we are happy to shed some light on any questions you may have!</p>
