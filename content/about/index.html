<p>The Business Analytics Organization (BAO) was formed to promote the intellectual and professional development of students with an interest in business analytics. We intend to create a common platform for analytics enthusiasts and help share their views and grow as a community.</p>
<p>We have events such as Analytics Speaker Series, Data Science Workshops, and Networking Events as part of our initiatives. The Data Science Workshops are a series of hands-on workshops organized by BAO for a better understanding of various concepts by students. Students generally work on a dataset/problem statement and get an exposure to the challenges a professional may face at work or learn how to use a new tool/software or explore a new area of analytics through these workshops. The</p>
<p>Analytics Speaker Series is a series of talks by professionals who are experienced in the industry and have seen how analytics is affecting their business. The speaker helps the students understand how analytics helps solve their business challenges. We collaborate with various speakers, industry experts from Chicago&rsquo;s data community and UIC Alumni who come to campus, speak and interact with our members.</p>
